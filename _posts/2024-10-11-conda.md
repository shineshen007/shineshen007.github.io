------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 创建环境

```
conda env list #查看已有环境

conda create -n R3.6

conda activate R3.6
```
## 添加镜像
```
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/bioconda
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
conda config --show
conda search r-base
```
## 安装R和R包
```
conda install r-base=3.6.1
which -a R
```
# 设置镜像
进入R
```
file.edit(file.path("~",".Rprofile"))  #打开一个文件

options("repos"=c(CRAN="https://mirrors.pku.edu.cn/CRAN/","The Comprehensive R Archive Network","http://mirrors.aliyun.com/CRAN"))
```

写完后，退出，重新进入R
```
options()$repos      #查看现有镜像
```
# 安装BiocManager
```
if (!require("BiocManager",quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(xcms)
```
# MASS,lattice安装报错
```
conda install -c conda-forge r-MASS
conda install -c conda-forge r-lattice
```
# 安装R包netcdf4错误
```
Ubuntu Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ncdf4’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib/R/library/00LOCK-ncdf4/00new/ncdf4/libs/ncdf4.so':
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0: undefined symbol: ffi_type_pointer, version LIBFFI_BASE_7.0
Error: loading failed
Execution halted
ERROR: loading failed
```
新建的conda环境以R3.6.3为基础，重新安装xcms包，遇到各种问题，查询Google未果，最终还是ChatGPT解决了，记录一下吧 

The error message indicates that there is a problem with loading the `ncdf4.so` shared object file due to an issue with a specific library (`libp11-kit.so.0`). The root of the issue is related to an undefined symbol (`ffi_type_pointer`) in the `libp11-kit.so.0` library, which suggests a conflict or mismatch between the versions of libraries used in your environment.

This could be happening because of conflicting versions of libraries managed by `conda` and the system libraries (`libffi` and `libp11-kit`), or possibly because of issues with your R environment setup.

Here are steps to help resolve this issue:

### 1. **Ensure `libffi` is Installed and Correct Version is Present**

The symbol `ffi_type_pointer` is part of `libffi`, so first, make sure that `libffi` is installed and correctly linked:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libffi-dev
```

### 2. **Rebuild the NetCDF Library and Ensure Compatibility**

In `conda` environments, library versions may sometimes conflict with system libraries. Rebuild the environment's libraries to ensure consistency:

```bash
conda update --all
```

Additionally, ensure that `libnetcdf` is installed in the conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge libnetcdf
```

### 3. **Verify the Correct `libp11-kit` is Installed**

The error mentions `libp11-kit.so.0`, so ensure that this library is properly installed:

```bash
sudo apt install libp11-kit0
```

You can also try reinstalling it to ensure that the correct version is present:
```bash
sudo apt reinstall libp11-kit0
```

### 4. **Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Avoid Conflicts**

You might be encountering conflicts between the system's libraries and those installed in the conda environment. To avoid this, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prioritize the conda environment's libraries:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then try reinstalling `ncdf4` again:

```r
install.packages("ncdf4")
```

### 5. **Rebuild the `ncdf4` Package in the Conda Environment**

Rebuild the `ncdf4` package within your conda environment to ensure it is correctly linked to the libraries provided by conda:

1. Activate your conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate R3.6
   ```

2. Reinstall `ncdf4` in R:
   ```r
   install.packages("ncdf4", type = "source")
   ```

### 6. **Use Conda to Manage R and Libraries**

If the conflict persists, you can consider installing both R and its libraries using `conda`, as this can avoid potential conflicts between system and conda libraries:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-ncdf4
```

This will ensure that everything (R, NetCDF, `ncdf4`) is managed under conda, which often simplifies dependency management.

### 7. **Check for System and Conda Version Conflicts**

If the issue persists, check the version of `libffi` and `libp11-kit` being used:

```bash
ldd /home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib/R/library/ncdf4/libs/ncdf4.so
```

This command will show the shared libraries that `ncdf4.so` is trying to link to. Look for any discrepancies between system and conda versions.

If there are any conflicts, you can try forcing conda to rebuild the environment's dependencies, or adjust the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so it prioritizes the conda environment's libraries over system libraries.

---

If none of these solutions work, sharing the output of the `ldd` command above may help to better understand the source of the conflict.
