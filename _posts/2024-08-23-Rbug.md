# 每当遇到很奇怪的错误并且Google查无此误的情况，就要多想想是哪里出的问题，一般都是低级错误
1: 代码不对 
2: 文件格式不对或损坏 
3: 电脑系统 
4: R版本，package版本，要保存一下之前work的时候的session info
## 1: xcms遇到的错误
```
nodes produced errors; first error: object 'rampIsFile'not found
```
这个错误是在使用并行计算的时候出现的，由于在多台电脑上都发生过，导致一开始始终找不到原因，最后发现将R降级到3.6，所有包重新安装之后终于解决。

## 2: MetNormalizer矫正遇到的错误
```
Stop worker failed with the error: wrong args for environment subassignment
Error: BiocParallel errors
  0 remote errors, element index: 
  8 unevaluated and other errors
  first remote error:
```
或者
```
Error in svm.default(QC[, cor.peak], QC[, i]) : 外接函数调用时不能有NA/NaN/Inf(arg4)
```
这些错误都是因为QC样本中有一些行全是0，但却报出并行计算的错误，去除qc中这些全是0的行即可

## 3.安装R包netcdf4错误
```
Ubuntu Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ncdf4’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib/R/library/00LOCK-ncdf4/00new/ncdf4/libs/ncdf4.so':
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0: undefined symbol: ffi_type_pointer, version LIBFFI_BASE_7.0
Error: loading failed
Execution halted
ERROR: loading failed
```
新建的conda环境以R3.6.3为基础，重新安装xcms包，遇到各种问题，查询Google未果，最终还是ChatGPT解决了，记录一下吧 

The error message indicates that there is a problem with loading the `ncdf4.so` shared object file due to an issue with a specific library (`libp11-kit.so.0`). The root of the issue is related to an undefined symbol (`ffi_type_pointer`) in the `libp11-kit.so.0` library, which suggests a conflict or mismatch between the versions of libraries used in your environment.

This could be happening because of conflicting versions of libraries managed by `conda` and the system libraries (`libffi` and `libp11-kit`), or possibly because of issues with your R environment setup.

Here are steps to help resolve this issue:

### 1. **Ensure `libffi` is Installed and Correct Version is Present**

The symbol `ffi_type_pointer` is part of `libffi`, so first, make sure that `libffi` is installed and correctly linked:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libffi-dev
```

### 2. **Rebuild the NetCDF Library and Ensure Compatibility**

In `conda` environments, library versions may sometimes conflict with system libraries. Rebuild the environment's libraries to ensure consistency:

```bash
conda update --all
```

Additionally, ensure that `libnetcdf` is installed in the conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge libnetcdf
```

### 3. **Verify the Correct `libp11-kit` is Installed**

The error mentions `libp11-kit.so.0`, so ensure that this library is properly installed:

```bash
sudo apt install libp11-kit0
```

You can also try reinstalling it to ensure that the correct version is present:
```bash
sudo apt reinstall libp11-kit0
```

### 4. **Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Avoid Conflicts**

You might be encountering conflicts between the system's libraries and those installed in the conda environment. To avoid this, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prioritize the conda environment's libraries:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then try reinstalling `ncdf4` again:

```r
install.packages("ncdf4")
```

### 5. **Rebuild the `ncdf4` Package in the Conda Environment**

Rebuild the `ncdf4` package within your conda environment to ensure it is correctly linked to the libraries provided by conda:

1. Activate your conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate R3.6
   ```

2. Reinstall `ncdf4` in R:
   ```r
   install.packages("ncdf4", type = "source")
   ```

### 6. **Use Conda to Manage R and Libraries**

If the conflict persists, you can consider installing both R and its libraries using `conda`, as this can avoid potential conflicts between system and conda libraries:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-ncdf4
```

This will ensure that everything (R, NetCDF, `ncdf4`) is managed under conda, which often simplifies dependency management.

### 7. **Check for System and Conda Version Conflicts**

If the issue persists, check the version of `libffi` and `libp11-kit` being used:

```bash
ldd /home/miniconda3/envs/R3.6/lib/R/library/ncdf4/libs/ncdf4.so
```

This command will show the shared libraries that `ncdf4.so` is trying to link to. Look for any discrepancies between system and conda versions.

If there are any conflicts, you can try forcing conda to rebuild the environment's dependencies, or adjust the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so it prioritizes the conda environment's libraries over system libraries.

---

If none of these solutions work, sharing the output of the `ldd` command above may help to better understand the source of the conflict.
