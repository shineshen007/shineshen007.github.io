The reason of import error in pythob almost related to version,
Most import errors are often related to version issues, but not necessarily with the package itself. It depends on which package is calling the problematic one,
leading to the issue. For instance, the error mentioned above is caused by a too-low version of the 'smatools' package, not by 'pandas'.

ImportError: cannot import name 'Int64Index' from 'pandas'
