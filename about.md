### Academic interest

My research pursuits lie at the intersection of Metabolomics, Systems Biology, and the integration of multi-omics data.  
I specialize in employing a spectrum of machine learning algorithms and analytical tools to dissect the complex datasets from metabolomics and other omics fields.  
This approach enables me to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of diseases and to identify pivotal biomarkers that are crucial for diagnosis, as well as for the prediction of clinical outcomes.
